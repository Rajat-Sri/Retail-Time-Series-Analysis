# Retail Time Series Analysis

## Overview
Time series analysis is a powerful statistical method used to analyze and forecast time-dependent data. In this project, we focus on retail time series analysis, specifically forecasting sales for furniture and office supplies categories. The dataset used is the Superstore sales data, which contains various categories of sales data, including furniture and office supplies.

## Data Preprocessing
The first step in any data analysis project is data preprocessing. In this stage, we handle missing values, outliers, correct data types, and create new features if necessary. For this project, we preprocess the Superstore sales data and extract the relevant information for the furniture and office supplies categories.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is a crucial step in understanding the data and gaining valuable insights. In this project, we perform EDA on the furniture and office supplies categories separately. We utilize various data visualization techniques, summary statistics, and hypothesis testing to analyze the sales trends, seasonal patterns, and other factors that might influence sales.

## Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis is the core of this project, as it involves analyzing time-dependent data to make predictions or forecasts. Two main methods are used for time series analysis:
1. ARIMA Model: The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a popular time series forecasting technique. We apply the ARIMA model to analyze the sales trends and forecast future sales for furniture and office supplies.
2. Prophet Tool: Facebook's Prophet tool is another powerful tool for time series analysis. We utilize Prophet to analyze sales trends and make predictions for both categories.

## Model Evaluation
Once the time series models are built, we need to evaluate their performance to ensure accuracy and reliability. In this project, we use metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) to assess the accuracy of our models.

## Interpretation and Insights
The final step in this project is to interpret the results and derive actionable insights. From our analysis, we find that both furniture and office supplies sales have been steadily increasing over time, with office supplies showing slightly stronger growth. We also identify the best and worst months for sales in both categories, providing valuable information for decision-making.

## Conclusion
The Retail Time Series Analysis project provides a comprehensive understanding of sales trends and patterns for furniture and office supplies in the Superstore dataset. By applying time series analysis techniques and forecasting models, we gain valuable insights into future sales trends, helping retailers make informed business decisions. This project demonstrates the significance of time series analysis in retail data and its potential to drive business growth and optimize strategies.
